    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        If you can't decide what to make for dinner, try this spicy pork and vegetable tofu dish: fast, easy, and tasty, it checks all the boxes for a satisfying meal and acts as a catch-all for any seasonal produce. All the individual ingredients taste distinct while blending seamlessly into one harmonious flavor bomb. Zucchini is our favorite veggie to showcase, especially if you take the extra 15 minutes to salt it, but pretty much any vegetables will shine.

        <li>1 Â¼ pounds boneless beef short ribs, sliced across the grain in 1/8-inch thick slices</li>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix garlic, grated onion, grated ginger, toasted sesame oil, and brown sugar together in a mixing bowl. Stir in grated pear, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Transfer meat to marinade and toss to coat on all sides. Cover and refrigerate, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Season meat with salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil. Toss.</li>
        <li>Brush a cast iron skillet with a little vegetable oil and place over high heat. When the skillet is very hot, add beef in a single layer and cook until meat begins to caramelize around the edges and moisture begins to evaporate, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve over hot rice and top with green onion slices.</li>
