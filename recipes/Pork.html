    <p>
        In addition to its impressive high-gloss appearance and savory taste, this Chinese barbeque pork is quite easy to make at home — even without a fancy ceramic grill.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¼ pounds boneless beef short ribs, sliced across the grain in 1/8-inch thick slices</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, finely crushed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated gingerroot</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil</li>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix garlic, grated onion, grated ginger, toasted sesame oil, and brown sugar together in a mixing bowl. Stir in grated pear, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Transfer meat to marinade and toss to coat on all sides. Cover and refrigerate, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Season meat with salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil. Toss.</li>
        <li>Brush a cast iron skillet with a little vegetable oil and place over high heat. When the skillet is very hot, add beef in a single layer and cook until meat begins to caramelize around the edges and moisture begins to evaporate, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve over hot rice and top with green onion slices.</li>
    </ol>
