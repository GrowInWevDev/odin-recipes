    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        In the best examples I've had of beef bulgogi in Korean restaurants, the meat, while tender, still had a little bit of chewiness to it. You can control texture by the thickness or thinness of the slices and how long you marinate them. But this Korean-style BBQ recipe has a fairly fast-acting marinade, so I go with an hour or two.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Â¼ pounds boneless beef short ribs, sliced across the grain in 1/8-inch thick slices</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, finely crushed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated gingerroot</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix garlic, grated onion, grated ginger, toasted sesame oil, and brown sugar together in a mixing bowl. Stir in grated pear, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Transfer meat to marinade and toss to coat on all sides. Cover and refrigerate, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Season meat with salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil. Toss.</li>
        <li>Brush a cast iron skillet with a little vegetable oil and place over high heat. When the skillet is very hot, add beef in a single layer and cook until meat begins to caramelize around the edges and moisture begins to evaporate, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve over hot rice and top with green onion slices.</li>
